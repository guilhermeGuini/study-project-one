# study-project-one

## Overview
Project to study all the cycle of development using spring, docker, kubernetes, and others

In this project we are going to build several microservices, or maybe not so microservices, simulating an ecommerce.

I'll explain a little bit about spring concepts, design patterns and others tecnologies.

## Services

Microservices:

- Cart service: responsible for managing items in the shopping cart.
- Customer service: responsible for managing customer data.
- Stock service: responsible for managing products in stock.
- Order service: responsible for orders management.
- Delivery service: responsible for delivering the products.

## Phases

Phase 1:
Build the services with the all rules

Phase 2:
Include security for all services

Phase 3:
Generate docker image for all services

Phase 4:
Run all images on k8s with zero-down-time

## Tech stack

- Spring boot framework (java)
- Non-blocking stack
- Orquestration design
- Coreography design
