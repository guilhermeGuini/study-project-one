# study-project-one
Project to study all the cycle of development using spring, docker, kubernetes, and others

In this project we are going to build several microservices, or maybe not so microservices, simulating an ecommerce.

I'll explain a little bit about spring concepts, design patterns and others tecnologies.


Microservices:

- Cart service: responsible for managing items in the shopping cart.
- Customer service: responsible for managing customer data.
- Stock service: responsible for managing products in stock.
- Order service: responsible for orders management.
- Delivery service: responsible for delivering the products.
